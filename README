A simple web crawler written in Python as part of a coding challenge.

The user enters in an initial url, a string to be searched on each page, and an integer which is the max depth to crawl to.

Only visited web pages (those that are parsed) are searched for the user keyword.

The program will output each url that was visited and whether or not the search word was found on that page.
